  What Is It? 
  -----------
  
  JDepend traverses Java class and source file directories and 
  generates design quality metrics for each Java package. JDepend allows 
  you to automatically measure the quality of a design in terms of its 
  extensibility, reusability, and maintainability to effectively manage 
  and control package dependencies.
