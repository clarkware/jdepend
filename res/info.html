The <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend</a> utility
analyzes directories of Java class files and generates the following metrics for
each Java package.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Afferent Coupling (Ca)
<p>
The number of packages that depend upon the classes within the analyzed
package.
</p>
</li>
<li>Efferent Coupling (Ce)
<p>
The number of packages that the classes in the analyzed package depend upon.
</p>
</li>
<li>Abstractness (A)
<p>
The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed
package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package.
</p>
<p>
The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely
concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.
</p>
</li>
<li>Instability (I)
<p>
The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca) such that I =
Ce / (Ce + Ca).
</p>
<p>
The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable
package and I=1 indicating a completely instable package.
</p>
</li>
<li>Distance from the Main Sequence (D)
<p>
The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. A
package coincident with the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect
to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely
abstract and stable (x=0, y=1) or completely concrete and instable (x=1,
y=0).
</p>
<p>
The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0 indicating a package that is
coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far
from the main sequence as possible.
</p>
</li>
<li>Package Dependency Cycle
<p>
Package dependency cycles are reported along with the paths of packages
participating in package dependency cycles.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These metrics are hereafter referred to as the "Martin Metrics", as they are
credited to Robert Martin (Object Mentor Inc.) and referenced in the book
"Designing Object Oriented C++ Applications using the Booch Method", by
Robert C. Martin, Prentice Hall, 1995.
